## Benchmarking Derivative-Free Optimization Algorithms

This repository contains source code and updates from the codes originally shared at https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~more/dfo/.
Ways to contribute; extensions to other problems and languages; and additional resources will be updated here.

---

The codes in this repository are based on the supplemental information for the paper:
- [[1](#pap1)] Benchmarking Derivative-Free Optimization Algorithms by J.J. Mor√© and S.M. Wild. *SIAM J. Optimization*, Vol. 20 (1), pp. 172-191, 2009. doi:[10.1137/080724083](https://doi.org/10.1137/080724083)

### Benchmark Problems
The following source files were used to define the benchmark problems in [[1](https://github.com/POptUS/BenDFO#pap1)]. Fortran files are found in `fortran/` and Octave/Matlab files are found in `m/`.

- `calfun` [[Fortran](fortran/calfun.f)]  [[Matlab/Octave](m/calfun.m)]:
  Code for evaluating the 22 CUTEr problems considered (needs dfovec).
- `dfovec` [[Fortran](fortran/dfovec.f)]  [[Matlab/Octave](m/dfovec.m)]:
  Code producing component vectors for the 22 CUTEr problems considered.
- `dfoxs` [[Fortran](fortran/dfoxs.f)]  [[Matlab/Octave](m/dfoxs.m)]:
  Code specifying the standard starting points.
- `dfo.dat` [Data file](data/dfo.dat):
  Data file specifying the benchmark problem set `P` through the integer parameters `(nprob, n, m, ns)`.

#### Types of Problems
There are 10 different forms of objective functions included, all using the same underlying equations.

The `smooth` problem type is deterministic and of the form
````
    f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^m F_i(x)^2
````

The `nondiff` problem type is deterministic and of the form
````
    f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^m | F_i(x) |
````

There are three deterministic noise problems based on the smooth function `f`:

- the `abswild` problem type is of the form `f(x) + phi(x)`, where `phi(x)` is a deterministic oscillatory function
- the `wild3` problem type is of the form `f(x) * (1 + 1e-3 * phi(x))`, where `phi(x)` is a deterministic oscillatory function
- the `relwild` problem type is of the form `f(x) * (1 + sigma * phi(x))`, where `phi(x)` is a deterministic oscillatory function, and `sigma` controls the noise level

Absolute stochastic noise versions are of the form
````
    f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^m (F_i(x) + z)^2
````

and include stochastic additive noise controlled by `sigma`:
- the `absnormal` problem type has components of `z` that are independent, mean zero, variance `sigma^2` Gaussian random variables
- the `absuniform` problem type has components of `z` that are independent uniform random variables, with mean zero and variance `sigma^2`

Relative stochastic noise versions are of the form
````
    f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^m (F_i(x) * (1 + z))^2
````

and include stochastic multiplicative noise controlled by `sigma` (except in the `noisy3` case):
- the `relnormal` problem type has components of `z` that are independent, mean zero, variance `sigma^2` Gaussian random variables
- the `reluniform` problem type has components of `z` that are independent uniform random variables, with mean zero and variance `sigma^2`
- the `noisy3` problem type has components of `z` that are independent, mean zero, variance (1e-3)^2 Gaussian random variables

#### (Sub)Derivative Information
For benchmarking purposes, derivative information is provided for the component functions `F_i(x)` defining each of the above problem types.

- `J` is the n-by-m Jacobian, with `J(j,i)` denoting the derivative of the ith equation with respect to the `j`th variable
- `G` is (or resembles, see below) a gradient of the objective `f`

Note:

- For the `smooth` problem type, `G = 2 * J * fvec` is the gradient
- For `abswild`, `wild3`, and `relwild` problem types, `G` ignores the oscillatory function
- For the `nondiff` problem type, `G = J * sign(fvec)` is a subgradient
- For `absnormal` and `absuniform` problem types, `G` is the gradient of the expected value of `f`
- For `relnormal`, `reluniform`, and `noisy3` problem types, `G` is the gradient of the expected value of `f`

### Plotting the Profiles
We provide the following Octave/Matlab files for producing basic data and performance profiles from data:

- `data_profile` [[Matlab/Octave](profiling/data_profile.m)]:
    Code for plotting a basic data profile.
- `perf_profile` [[Matlab/Octave](profiling/perf_profile.m)]:
    Code for plotting a basic performance profile.

Updates and other languages will be reflected here. Please also see:

- [Julia package for data and performance profiles](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/BenchmarkProfiles.jl)

### Derivatives and Testing
Autodiff versions (using [adimat](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/sc/res/sw/adimat/index.en.jsp)) of the problem derivatives are also included.

A sample calling script for testing and to see these derivative capabilities is provided in `testbendfo.m` [[Matlab/Octave](profiling/testbendfo.m)].
